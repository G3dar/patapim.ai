# Referral Program

Refer 10 friends to PATAPIM and unlock Pro lifetime for free. No payment required — just share your link and watch your progress.

## How It Works

1. **Get your referral link** from the referral panel
2. **Share it** with friends, colleagues, or your community
3. **They sign up** for a PATAPIM account through your link
4. **You track progress** in the referral panel
5. **At 10 referrals**, you automatically unlock Pro lifetime

That's it. Ten sign-ups and you get every Pro feature, forever.

## Your Referral Link

Each signed-in user gets a unique referral link. To find it:

1. Open the referral panel (see [Accessing the Panel](#accessing-the-panel) below)
2. Your unique link is displayed at the top
3. Click **"Copy"** to copy it to your clipboard
4. Share it anywhere — email, chat, social media, blog posts

## Tracking Your Progress

The referral panel shows your current status:

- **Referral count** — how many friends have signed up (e.g., "4/10 referrals")
- **Progress bar** — visual indicator of how close you are to unlocking Pro
- **Goal** — 10 successful referrals to unlock Pro lifetime

A referral counts when the person creates a PATAPIM account using your unique link. They do not need to purchase a plan.

## Accessing the Panel

There are two ways to open the referral panel:

**Gift icon in sidebar:**
- A gift icon appears in the sidebar header for Free tier users
- Click it to open the referral panel directly
- This icon is hidden for Pro users since they already have Pro

**View menu:**
- Go to **View > Referrals**
- Available for all users regardless of plan
- Pro users can still check their referral count here

## Requirements

- **You must be signed in** to use the referral program
- **Referred friends must create a PATAPIM account** by visiting your unique referral link
- Sign-ups through other means (direct website visit, other referral links) do not count toward your total

## FAQ

**What if I already have Pro?**
The gift icon in the sidebar is hidden since you already have Pro. You can still access the referral panel via **View > Referrals** to check your referral count.

**Do my referrals need to buy Pro?**
No. They just need to create a free PATAPIM account through your link.

**When does Pro activate?**
As soon as your 10th referral signs up, Pro lifetime is applied to your account automatically. You may need to wait for the next heartbeat cycle (up to 2 minutes) for the change to appear.

**Can I combine referrals with a paid plan?**
If you already have a paid Pro subscription and later reach 10 referrals, your account upgrades to Pro lifetime and your subscription billing stops.
